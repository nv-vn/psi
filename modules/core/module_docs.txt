== Core module -- imported everywhere cause ya
-- contains core types
== String 
-- in reality, is an array of Chars.
-- really coool feature, range notation
val x = "Hello"
-- now lets say we wanted just the o.
-- we could do, 
val o = x[4..] -- x.. means x until the end of the string, x.length.
-- want just the o CHARACTER?
val oChar = x[4] -- simple, grab the character at the 4th index
